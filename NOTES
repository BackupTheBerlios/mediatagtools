  This version fixes a couple of small bugs and adds support for ogg and flac files.
Actually mediatagtools should be able to handle all file types that taglib support but for
now I want to focus on mp3,ogg and flac files. All info is saved as utf8 in the tags so
you shouldn't have any trouble reading it using any decent media program. If you find
any bugs, or you have any suggestions, feel free to make a bug report on berlios or email me. Have fun! :-)
