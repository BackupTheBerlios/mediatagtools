  In case your genre field has a strange number when loading some audio files for the first time,
please save the tags and reload the files. That is a know bug of taglib that has been fixed in the svn version and
it will be included in the next release of taglib. I want to thank the developers of taglib for their immediate
response to my bug report and of course for creating taglib!
  One last thing that you might notice is that there is a folder named translations. Yes! Now the program can talk to
you in your language (provided that some kind soul provides a translation of the messages :-P).
  If you find any bugs, or you have any suggestions, feel free to make a bug report on berlios or email me.
  Have fun! :-)
