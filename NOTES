  One thing that you might notice is that there is a folder named translations. Yes! Now the program can talk to
you in your language (provided that some kind soul provides a translation of the messages :-P).
  If you find any bugs, or you have any suggestions, feel free to make a bug report on berlios or email me.
  Have fun! :-)
