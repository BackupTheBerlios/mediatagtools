  If you have the previous beta version installed,
upgrade immediately as it has some nasty bugs.

  This is the second beta version of Media Tag Tools.
For now it supports tagging mp3 files but soon
every media file supported by taglib will be
taggable by Media Tag Tools. Some options don't work
for now and thus they appear grayed out all the time
although most of the features work fine.
  Media Tag Tools prefers writing UTF8 strings in the
tags and that can only be possible with id3v2.4 tags.
So if a id3v1 tag is found, its contents are copied to
the appropriate id3v2 fields and then the v1 tag is
removed from the file. So if you prefer v1 tags this
program isn't for you! I won't add support for v1 tags
are they cause more problems to people than they are
useful.
