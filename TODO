Qt4 Porting:
* Window icon (get rid of that pink/purple X!)

* Pressing Enter in QComboBox should send the focus to the LineEdit below it. Should I subclass it?
* Make the color of changed items configurable
* New name and old name shouldn't be the same while renaming...
* Custom tags for mp3/ogg files
* Add folders recursively
* Add Music Brainz support
* Convert tags from any iso charset to utf8
* Autonumbering
	* Almost done. Need to figure out how to move items around in model/view
* Show an error message when a tag cannot be saved for some reason
