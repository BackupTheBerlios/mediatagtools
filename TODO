Normal:
* Show artwork instead of just the audio cd icon
* Show album art if available per file
* Make the color of changed items configurable
* Custom tags for mp3/ogg files
* Add folders recursively
* Add Music Brainz support
* Convert tags from any iso charset to utf8
* Show an error message when a tag cannot be saved for some reason
* Add sqlite support to autocomplete tag fields

Minor:
* Pressing Enter in QComboBox should send the focus to the LineEdit below it. Should I subclass it?
