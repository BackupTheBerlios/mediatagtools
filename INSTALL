  You need the following packages to be able to compile mediatagtools: qt3 and taglib-1.4
If you have installed precompiled packages of these two libs, be sure to check if you have
also installed the -dev packages too.

Now unpack the archive and then inside the directory that was created the following
commands (without the #):

# qmake
# make

and optionally if you want the program installed in /usr/local/bin:

# INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/local/ make install

Set INSTALL_ROOT to where you want to install the file. make install will then
create a folder named bin and in there it will copy the program.
Have fun! :-)
