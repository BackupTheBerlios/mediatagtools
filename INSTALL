Just run the following commands (without the #):

# qmake
# make

and optionally if you want the program installed in /usr/local/bin:

# INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/local/ make install

Set INSTALL_ROOT to where you want to install the file. make install will then
create a folder named bin and in there it will copy the program.
Have fun! :-)
