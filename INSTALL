  You need the following packages to be able to compile mediatagtools: qt3 and taglib-1.4
If you have installed precompiled packages of these two libs, be sure to check if you have
also installed the -dev packages too.

Now unpack the archive and then inside the directory that was created the following
commands (without the #):

# ./configure
# make
# make install (make sure you are logged in as root before this one)

Have fun! :-)
